Usage
-----

You can use this role in a playbook or as another role's dependency.

With a playbook:
- add the Galaxy ID or repository URL to your requirements
- run `ansible-galaxy install -r â€¦` to install requirements
- call the role from a `roles:` clause in a play

As another role's dependency:
- add the Galaxy ID or repository URL to the `dependencies:` list of the role manifest `meta/main.yml`
- roles dependencies are always executed before the role that includes them
